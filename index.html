        <p>Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who is widely regarded as one of the most important scientists of the 20th century. He is best known for developing the theory of general relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. Einstein also made important contributions to the development of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, and he is credited with discovering the photoelectric effect, which provided evidence for the wave-particle duality of light. In addition to his scientific work, Einstein was also an outspoken pacifist and civil rights activist, and he remains an icon of scientific and intellectual achievement to this day.</p>

          <p>Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential scientists of the 20th century. Here are some key experiences from his life:</p>
          <h4>Early Life</h4>
    <p>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879 in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg, in the German Empire. He grew up in a middle-class Jewish family, and his father ran an electrical equipment business.</p>
    <h4>Education</h4>
    <p>Einstein attended school in Munich and later in Switzerland, where he excelled in math and science. After finishing school, he applied to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, but initially failed the entrance exam. He spent a year studying at a Swiss school to improve his math skills, and was eventually admitted to the institute in 1896.</p>
    <h4>The Annus Mirabilis</h4>
    <p>In 1905, Einstein published four papers that had a profound impact on the development of modern physics. These papers dealt with the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy (E=mc²). This year is often referred to as Einstein's "miracle year".</p>
    <h4>General Relativity</h4>
    <p>In 1915, Einstein published his theory of general relativity, which describes the way gravity works in the universe. This theory was a major breakthrough in physics and has been confirmed by numerous experiments since then.</p>
    <h4>Nobel Prize</h4>
    <p>Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his work on theoretical physics, specifically for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.</p>
    <h4>Later Life</h4>
    <p>Einstein emigrated to the United States in 1933 to escape Nazi persecution, and became a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He continued to work on physics throughout his life, but also became an outspoken advocate for peace and civil rights.</p>
    <h4>Death</h4>
    <p>Einstein died on April 18, 1955 at the age of 76 in Princeton, New Jersey. His brain was preserved for scientific study, and has been the subject of much research into the structure and function of the human brain.</p>
